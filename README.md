# Wine Quality Analysis and Predictive Modeling

## Overview
This repository explores the factors influencing wine quality using data analysis and predictive modeling techniques. We analyze the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes chemical properties of red and white wines along with their quality ratings.

## Motivation
Understanding the chemical characteristics that contribute to high-quality wine is crucial for wine producers and enthusiasts alike. This analysis aims to uncover insights that can enhance production processes and quality assessment.

## Repository Contents
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks containing detailed analysis and code.
  - `wine_quality_analysis.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation analysis, and feature selection.
  - `wine_quality_preprocessing.ipynb`: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature scaling.
  - `wine_quality_modeling.ipynb`: Machine learning models for predicting wine quality.

- **Data**: Contains the Wine Quality dataset (`winequality.csv`) sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Analysis Steps
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize distributions of chemical properties.
   - Explore relationships between features and wine quality.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Scale features using standard scaling.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Identify correlations between features and wine quality using heatmaps and statistical tests.

4. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Build and evaluate models to predict wine quality based on selected features.

## Results and Insights
- Discover which chemical properties most strongly influence wine quality.
- Evaluate the performance of machine learning models in predicting wine quality ratings.
- Provide actionable insights for wine producers to improve production processes and quality control.
