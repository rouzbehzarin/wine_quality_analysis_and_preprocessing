# Wine Quality Analysis and Preprocessing

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`wine_quality_analysis_and_preprocessing.ipynb`) that explores the factors influencing wine quality through data analysis and preprocessing techniques. The analysis focuses on the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes chemical properties of red and white wines along with their quality ratings.

## Motivation
Understanding the chemical characteristics that contribute to high-quality wine is crucial for wine producers and enthusiasts alike. This analysis aims to uncover insights that can enhance production processes and quality assessment.

## Notebook Content
The Jupyter Notebook (`wine_quality_analysis_and_preprocessing.ipynb`) covers the following steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize distributions of chemical properties.
   - Explore relationships between features and wine quality.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Scale features using standard scaling.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Identify correlations between features and wine quality using heatmaps and statistical tests.

## Results and Insights
- Discover which chemical properties most strongly influence wine quality.
- Prepare the dataset for further analysis or modeling tasks.

## Data Source
The Wine Quality dataset is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality).
